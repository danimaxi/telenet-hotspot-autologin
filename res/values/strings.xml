    <string name="helptext">This app is useful for Telenet customers who also have a Telenet Hotspot subscription.\n 
    Just save your username and password and the app will automatically log you in when you are connected to a Telenet Hotspot.\n 
    No need to keep the application running, we just listen for changes in the WIFI-connection.\n 
    When you are connected to a Telenet Hotspot, this app will also show you a login/logout button to manually log in/out.\n
    You can also sort your favourite WIFI-stations. In case there\'s more than 1 available, the highest in the list will be chosen.\n
    This is especially important if you also run a Homespot at home but rather want to be logged into your private WIFI-network.\n
