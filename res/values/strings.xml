    <string name="helptext">This app is useful for Telenet customers who also have a Telenet Hotspot subscription.\nJust save your username and password and the app will automatically log you in when you are connected to a Telenet Hotspot.\n\nNo need to keep the application running, we just listen for changes in the WIFI-connection.\nWhen you are connected to a Telenet Hotspot, this app will also show you a login/logout button to manually log in/out.\n\nYou can also sort your hotspots connection order. Items on top of the list, will be prefered before items after them. This way you can put your favourite wireless networks on top to be sure you get connected to them first.</string>
